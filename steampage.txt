[b]Overview[/b]

Better Lights adds configurable dynamic lighting to Garry's Mod: muzzle flashes, bullet impacts, projectiles, NPCs, items, fires, and explosions.

[b]I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PLAY THIS MOD ON THE 64-BIT BRANCH[/b]

The 64-Bit branch is what this addon was developed, tested, and targeted for. In most cases, your game will run significantly better on this branch.

[b]Configuration[/b]

Open the spawn menu tab: [b]Better Lights[/b].  
Each feature includes options for Enable, Color, Size, Brightness, Decay, and Reset to Defaults.
