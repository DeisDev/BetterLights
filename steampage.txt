I can help you better there than in the comment section :)


[b]Overview[/b]

Better Lights adds dynamic lighting to Garry's Mod: muzzle flashes, bullet impacts, projectiles, NPCs, items, fires, and explosions.

[b]I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PLAY THIS MOD ON THE 64-BIT BRANCH[/b]

The 64-Bit branch is what this addon was developed, tested, and targeted for. In most cases, your game will run significantly better on this branch.

[b]Configuration[/b]

Open the spawn menu tab: [b]Better Lights[/b].  
Each feature includes options for Enable, Color, Size, Brightness, Decay, and Reset to Defaults.

[b]Where did the comments go? [/b]

Look, I get it. I used AI to help with parts of this addon. If that bothers you, you don’t have to use it. What I don’t get is people spamming my profile or trying to argue with me over it. 

AI is just a tool, and I used it the same way a lot of developers already do. If that’s something you’re against, that’s fine. Just don't download the addon and continue on with your lives. And if you’re gonna be upset about AI in code, maybe take it up with [url=https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html]Microsoft[/url]
